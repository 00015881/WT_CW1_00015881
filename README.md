The local company I chose for coursework was "Tim's" cafe. The Tim's cafe has its' own website which is available from following link:https://tims.uz/. I tried to change design layout of a website to make it more appealing. My website includes 6 pages that were created using semantic tags, images, CSS visual effects and links to  which are: home, about, ask us, contacts and menu. Each of them has a unique design and provides full information about the cafe. Customers can interact with a website using "Ask Us" page. The contacts page includes links to the social media of Tim's cafe. The website's images and logos are all relevant to the website and have been given meaningful names in html and css. The process of creating this website was not very easy, the hardest part for me was creating javascript in the "Ask us" page. Unfortunately, I could not make my website responsive for mobilephone and tablet, however it works efficiently on a desktop.
